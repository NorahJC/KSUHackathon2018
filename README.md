Challenge Prompt: 

The FinTech industry serves billions of global customers daily. With services ranging from banking to payments to wealth management and beyond, innovation in the space continues to expand the reach and types of offerings. 

Much of this innovation is driven by the exchange of digital financial data. Data that largely remains private due to the sensitive nature of the information. What would be possible if more service providers could build on top of this wealth of information?

InComm is challenging developers like you to create innovative solutions based on our prototype Account Management API. This API grants third-party services controlled access to customer account information. Build on this data to create mobile, AI, wearable, or smart home applications that help consumers enjoy a convenient, secure, and rewarding payment experience.

Challenge Response:

Create android mobile app that allows customers to conviently shop at stores. The idea, once security is integrated, is to allow customers to scan items as they go through the store instead of having to go through customer check-out and wait in lines.
